# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **Linear Regression** using Python and popular data science libraries.  
The project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model with `scikit-learn`.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository.  
 
**Description:** Contains user-related features (such as purchase history, spending, etc.) that are used to predict target values.
